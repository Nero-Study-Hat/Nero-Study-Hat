Hello there, I am an avid homelabber and NixOS desktop user.

## My current main projects.

[Homelab](https://github.com/Nero-Study-Hat/Homelab)

I have three main missions I am working toward here with the first being to make useful services available to myself and some people I care about.

The second purpose is to act as my little cybersecurity shadow boxing ring where I setup all my infrasture with my limited resources and work towards securing it all as best I can. During this process I brainstorm ways the services I will be running, clients I serve, and more can be used as part of an attack on my infra. From there I learn about tools and approaches that can make these paths in as thorny as possible.

The third purpose is simply to learn and tinker on a broad level. Infrastructure as Code is a big interest of mine as well as automation so this lab serves as my playground for that and more.

[NixOS Configs](https://github.com/Nero-Study-Hat/nixos-config)

The reason I use NixOS is because of built in rollback as well as the declaritive configuration of the immutable OS which forces me to have every change to system configuration documented and also restorable to another device easily.

I have really taken this a long way from the small test it was when I moved from Arch but there is still a lot more work to do with additional security features, improving my KDE setup, custom ISOs, and more.

## Projects stalled out currently.
